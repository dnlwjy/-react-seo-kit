# react-seo-kit

This kit helps you generate higher SEO score which includes site metadata, Open Graph tags, Twitter Cards, canonical URLs, structured data, and I also have included Breadcrumbs for better Google indexing results and Google Search Console. I have used this react components multiple times for both professional and personal projects. 

The component is written in **TypeScript** and powered by **react-helmet-async**.
